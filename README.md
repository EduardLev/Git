# Git in Python

An attempt at following along with `Building Git` by James Coglan:
https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/

A python tool that mimics the structure and some functionality of `git`.

You can run this locally!
Run `pit.py init` to initialize a "git" repository.
`pit.py commit` takes input from standard command line input, so you can create a commit message like this:
`echo "My commit message" | pit.py commit`

YMMV.
